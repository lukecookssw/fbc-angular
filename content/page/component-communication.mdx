## Overview

In this lesson, we will refactor our company table to be a 'presentation' component (also known as a 'dumb' component). 

It will be a child component of the company-list component, and we will pass the list of companies from the company-list down to the company-table.

### Learning Outcomes: 
- How to communicate between components
- How to create presentation components
- Understand the [difference between 'smart' and 'presentational' components](https://blog.angular-university.io/angular-2-smart-components-vs-presentation-components-whats-the-difference-when-to-use-each-and-why/)

## Create the component using the Angular CLI

- Open a command prompt and generate a new component for the company table.

```
ng generate component company/company-table --skip-tests
```

## Move the company HTML table to the company-table component
#####TIME: 5 min

- Move the Html table from the HTML template for company-list onto the HTML template for company-table

Company table should now look like this: 

**src/app/company/company-table/company-table.component.html**
```
<table class="table table-striped">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Email</th>
            <th>Phone</th>
            <th></th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr *ngFor="let company of companies$ | async ">
            <td>{{company.name}}</td>
            <td>{{company.email}}</td>
            <td>{{company.phone}}</td>
            <td class="company-actions">
                <button class="btn btn-primary">Edit</button>
                <button class="btn btn-outline-danger" (click)="deleteCompany(company.id)">Delete</button>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
```

- Don't worry about the errors, we are going to fix the code pretty soon.

- Move table CSS to child component
**src/app/company/company-table/company-table.component.scss**

```
.company-actions {
    width: 140px;
    white-space: nowrap
}

.company-actions .btn {
  margin: 0 5px;
}
```

## Update the code for the table-component

To refactor the company table from the company-list to the company-table we are going to:
- Update the component class to be able to receive data 
- Update the component class to be able to emit an event when the delete button is clicked.

First thing first, let's fix the errors in our CompanyTable component HTML:

1. Add a "companies" property and an empty method for "deleteCompany()" to our new component:

**src/app/company/company-table/company-table.component.ts**

```
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { Company } from '../company';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';

@Component({
  selector: 'fbc-company-table',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule],
  templateUrl: './company-table.component.html',
  styleUrl: './company-table.component.scss'
})
export class CompanyTableComponent {
  companies!: Company[];

  deleteCompany(id: number){
    // TODO: Implement a deleteCompany method in CompanyTable
  }
}
```

2. This new child component should be as "dumb" as possible and should just display a list of companies, therefore change from:
```
<tr *ngFor="let company of companies$ | async ">
```

to:
```
<tr *ngFor="let company of companies">
```


Now, to pass data into components and emit events we need the ```@Input``` and ```@Output``` decorators and the ```EventEmitter``` module.

- update the imports for the ```CompanyTable``` component

**src/app/company/company-table/company-table.component.ts**

```
import { Component, OnInit, Input, Output, EventEmitter } from '@angular/core';
import { Company } from '../company';
```

- use the two new decorators to create an Input() and an Output()

**src/app/company/company-table/company-table.component.ts**

```
@Input() 
companies: Company[];

@Output() 
deleteCompanyClicked: EventEmitter<number> = new EventEmitter<number>();
```

The updated company-table component should look like this: 

```
import { Component, OnInit, Input, Output, EventEmitter } from '@angular/core';
import { Company } from '../company';

@Component({
  selector: 'fbc-company-table',
  templateUrl: './company-table.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./company-table.component.scss']
})
export class CompanyTableComponent implements OnInit {
  @Input() 
  companies!: Company[];
  
  @Output() 
  deleteCompanyClicked: EventEmitter<number> = new EventEmitter<number>();

  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit() {
  }
  
  deleteCompany(id: number){
    // TODO: Implement a deleteCompany method in CompanyTable
  }
}
```


## Update the company-table template to call deleteCompanyClicked
#####TIME: 5 min

// ⚠️ TODO: the next steps are inconsistent: in delete(), do we pass company or company.id?
// I think deleteCompany(company) below should actually stay deleteCompany(company.id)

- Update the '(click)' event on the button.

**src/app/company/company-table/company-table.component.html**

```
<button class="btn btn-outline-danger" (click)="deleteCompany(company)">Delete</button>
```

- Update the component code with the following:

**src/app/company/company-table/company-table.component.ts**

```
    deleteCompany(id: number) {
        this.deleteCompanyClicked.emit(id);
    }
```


> Note that you can also call '.emit()' directly from the template:

**src/app/company/company-table/company-table.component.html**

```
<button class="btn btn-outline-danger" (click)="deleteCompanyClicked.emit(company.id)">Delete</button>
```



## Update the html for the company-list component

Now that we have moved the company-table out onto a separate control, we need to add that control on the (parent) company-list control.

The company-list component should now look like this: 

**src/app/company/company-list/company-list.component.html**

// ⚠️ TODO: why was float-end changed to pull-right below?


```
<h1>
    Companies
    <button class="btn btn-success pull-right">Add</button>
</h1> 
<fbc-company-table [companies]="(companies$ | async) || []" (deleteCompanyClicked)="deleteCompany($event)"></fbc-company-table> 
```

## EXTRA: Demonstrate OnPush change detection 

Presentational Components are deliberately simple: they contain no logic, receive property values from their `@Input` properties and raise events via their `@Output` `EventEmitter`s.

This simplicity makes them the perfect place to start investigating Angular's Change Detection settings. First we will add some debug code to demonstrate how often the Angular framework evaluates a template in with the default change detection strategy.

Add a logging function to your component:
**src/app/company/company-list/company-list.component.ts**

```
    logChanges() {
        console.log('CHANGES !!!');
    }
```

And then call that function directly from your template. Note that binding component functions directly to the template is not recommended - for reasons that will soon become clear!

```
<h1>
    Companies
    <button class="btn btn-success pull-right">Add</button>
</h1>
<fbc-company-table [companies]="(companies$ | async) || []" (deleteCompanyClicked)="deleteCompany($event)"></fbc-company-table> 

{{logChanges()}}

```

Reload the app with the chrome dev tools console open, and you will see that the `logChanges()` function was called many times - indicating that the Angular template was executed many times. 
When binding data into a template, you should bind to properties and not functions as that function will be executed each time the Angular change detection process re-evaluate the angular template.

### OnPush Change detection

The default change detection process in Angular is quite aggressive. It needs to re-evaluate templates frequently to make sure that changes to component properties are applied to the DOM. 
You can change this process to use OnPush Change Detection. This will only re-evaluate the template when:
1. An `@Input` value changes
2. An event (`@Output`) is raised by this component or one of this component's children

Update the change detection strategy in the component's metadata
**src/app/company/company-list/company-list.component.ts**

// ⚠️ TODO: I had to make the change in company-list, not company-table

```

@Component({
     selector: 'fbc-company-list',
     standalone: true,
     imports: [CommonModule, CompanyTableComponent],
     templateUrl: './company-list.component.html',
     styleUrl: './company-list.component.scss',
     changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
export class CompanyListComponent {

```

Reload with the chrome dev tools open and you should see that the template is only evaluated twice: when the component first loads and when the `@Input` receives data as loaded from the server.
